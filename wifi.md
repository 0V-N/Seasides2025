## Ethics and Legal Considerations

WiFi hacking, while an intriguing and valuable skill in the field of cybersecurity, comes with significant ethical and legal responsibilities. It's essential to remember that accessing or tampering with networks without explicit permission is illegal and can lead to severe legal consequences.  

This section emphasizes the importance of practicing ethical hacking:  
- Always obtain proper authorization before attempting to test or exploit any network.  
- Respect privacy and property rights, ensuring your actions do not harm others.  
- Use your skills responsibly, focusing on improving security and helping others protect their systems.  

Ethical hacking should be performed in controlled environments, such as your own network or an authorized training setting. Stay within the boundaries of the law and contribute positively to the cybersecurity community.
